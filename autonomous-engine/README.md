## 2. Daily 200 Contributions Distribution Model

To achieve a consistent target of **200 genuine contributions per day** without creating spam or hitting GitHub secondary rate limits, the system distributes tasks across **8 execution windows** throughout the day:

| Execution Cycle | Time (UTC) | Time (IST) | Target Commit Budget | Purpose |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Cycle 1 (Primary)** | `03:30 UTC` | **09:00 AM IST** | **~25 Commits** | Morning governance & core documentation audit |
| **Cycle 2** | `06:30 UTC` | **12:00 PM IST** | **~25 Commits** | POSIX newline & file formatting passes |
| **Cycle 3** | `09:30 UTC` | **03:00 PM IST** | **~25 Commits** | Markdown table & syntax normalization |
| **Cycle 4** | `12:30 UTC` | **06:00 PM IST** | **~25 Commits** | Configuration files & `.gitignore` hygiene |
| **Cycle 5** | `15:30 UTC` | **09:00 PM IST** | **~25 Commits** | Script permissions & executable bit audit |
| **Cycle 6** | `18:30 UTC` | **12:00 AM IST** | **~25 Commits** | Self-updating workflow optimization pass |
| **Cycle 7** | `21:30 UTC` | **03:00 AM IST** | **~25 Commits** | Code cleanliness & trailing whitespace sweep |
| **Cycle 8** | `00:30 UTC` | **06:00 AM IST** | **~25 Commits** | Ledger reconciliation & daily telemetry update |
| **Total Daily Capacity** | — | — | **200 Commits / Day** | **100% Genuine, Validated Repository Work** |

> **Zero-Fabrication Clause:** If a cycle finds fewer than 25 legitimate tasks to perform, it commits **only the exact number of verified improvements found** and gracefully terminates. It never generates artificial, empty, or meaningless commits.

## 3. Predefined Inspection Modules

The engine operates 5 deterministic inspection modules in [`scripts/maintenance.sh`](./scripts/maintenance.sh):

1. **Governance & Standards Module:**
   - Detects missing `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or `.editorconfig` files and establishes standardized project policies.
2. **Code Quality & POSIX Compliance Module:**
   - Enforces POSIX-compliant trailing newlines across all text files.
   - Audits shell scripts for executable permission bits (`chmod +x`).
   - Removes trailing whitespace from non-markdown source files.
   - Pre-validates all shell scripts using `bash -n`.
3. **Documentation Integrity Module:**
   - Normalizes Markdown horizontal rules to standard 3-dash `---` dividers.
   - Inserts missing architecture and workflow documentation sections.
4. **Configuration & Security Hygiene Module:**
   - Audits `.gitignore` to ensure OS artifact exclusion (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.bak`) and secret exclusion (`*.pem`, `*.key`, `.env`, `.env.local`).
   - Alphabetically deduplicates and sorts ignore rules.
5. **Self-Updating Automation Module:**
   - Audits `.github/workflows/daily-200-contributions.yml` for missing concurrency locks and injects race-condition prevention groups.
   - Enforces least-privilege permissions (`contents: write` instead of `write-all`).
   - Performs syntax self-diagnostics on its own Bash implementation.

## 4. Multi-Repository Setup Guide

To run this engine across multiple repositories from a single workflow:

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (Classic) with `repo` and `workflow` permissions.
2. Add the token to repository **Settings $\rightarrow$ Secrets and variables $\rightarrow$ Actions** as `GH_PAT`.
3. Configure target repositories in `scripts/maintenance.sh` by supplying the `TARGET_REPOS` environment variable:
   ```yaml
   env:
     TARGET_REPOS: "Tharun4743/Resume Tharun4743/taskmanager Tharun4743/GOAT-CE"
   ```
4. The script will iterate through each repository, clone or pull the default branch, execute inspection modules, validate diffs, commit, push, and record entries in the ledger.

## 5. Security & Rollback Protocol

* **Pre-Commit Secret Inspection Jail:**
  Every staged diff is scanned against regular expressions matching GitHub PATs (`ghp_`), API keys, and private keys. If a sensitive pattern is detected, the commit is aborted immediately and the stage is reset.
* **No Force Pushes:**
  All pushes use `git pull --rebase` and standard `git push origin main`. Force pushes are strictly disabled.
* **Rollback Instructions:**
  If an unintended modification is committed:
  ```bash
  git revert <COMMIT_SHA> --no-edit
  git push origin main
  ```
  Every commit is recorded with its full SHA in [`CONTRIBUTION_HISTORY.md`](./CONTRIBUTION_HISTORY.md) for instant auditing and rollback.

## 6. Local Testing & Verification

Test the entire maintenance engine locally before pushing:

```bash
# Run in Dry-Run mode (inspects and validates without committing or pushing)
export DRY_RUN="true"
export MAX_COMMITS_PER_RUN="25"
bash scripts/maintenance.sh

# Run live local execution
export DRY_RUN="false"
bash scripts/maintenance.sh
```

## Architecture & Workflow

The autonomous contribution engine executes distributed maintenance cycles using:
1. **POSIX Shell Core:** Native `bash` scripts with zero third-party runtimes.
2. **Safety Jails:** Diff inspection before commit stages to eliminate secret exposure.
3. **Atomic Verification:** Amends self-recorded audit ledgers to maintain git hygiene.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How does the engine adhere to the zero-fabrication rule?
The engine only commits verified structural, documentation, or code improvements (governance files, code style, gitignore hardening, automated tests, posix compliance). When all checks pass, it reports 0 commits and exits cleanly without creating artificial activity.

### How are secrets prevented from being committed?
A pre-commit staged diff scanner inspects every staged file before committing. If high-entropy tokens, private keys, or API credentials match the inspection regex, the staging is aborted immediately.
